csgosl supports creating and hosting your own map groups. As long as the maps in the map group are either one of the standard maps installed when you installed the CSGO server or a Steam workshop map your friends will automatically download the maps from the Steam workshop. 

To create a map group select the [Map Group tab](Help on Map Groups), enter a map group name, press ENTER, double-click the map group and select which maps to include. Your done! Now select the newly created map group in the [Run tab](Help on Run) and start the server.

You can of course still create your own Steam workshop map groups (or collections) and host them as described in [Host workshop map groups](Host workshop map groups). The above is just a faster and easier way to quickly create a new map group and get playing...
