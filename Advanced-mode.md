The advanced mode is enabled in the application tab by enabling option fullconfig and restarting csgosl. This will enable a number of new config tabs, All_modes and one tab per game mode.

The options you set in the All_modes tab will be propagated to all other game modes. Leave the option blank to not propagate values.

The options you set in a game mode specific tab will only be active for that game mode.
