![Console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/lenosisnickerboa/csgosl/pics/config-page-console.jpg)

This page is only available in the csgosl windows version. This is where traces from csgosl and commands executed by csgosl (steamcmd, srcds, ...) go. In linux the windows where you started csgosl is used for this.

The console can be useful for troubleshooting things when something doesn't work.
