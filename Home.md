# Welcome to the csgosl wiki!

csgosl is a graphical user interface for a Counter Striker Global Offensive (CSGO) server. csgosl supports easy one-click install, update, start and stop server on windows and linux platforms ([supported platforms](Platform-support)). If you just want your own CSGO server up and running with reasonable default settings this is the place for you.
