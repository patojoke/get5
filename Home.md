* [Host public server](Host public server)
* [Host workshop maps](Host workshop maps)

There is also help on each of the tabs in the application, "Help on ...". Simply select them from the right sidebar.

Every setting has a "Set default" button (an eraser) to the right of it. Settings can also be set to default values per configuration page using the "Set defaults" button on the top right part of the page. Finally, there is a button for setting all settings back to default values. That button is located at the bottom of the Application configuration page.

In case you discover a bug you may read the [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting) page on how to enable traces and submit an error report so I can fix the problem.

Finally, developers should read [Developers information](Developers information).
