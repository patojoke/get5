The multiple server support is very basic and not intended for hosting a large amount of servers. But it is simple, and it works, and can be made smarter for those who cares about disk space.

All you need to do is copy the folder of a working csgosl installation. Simply copy the complete folder, done!

Now start the new server in the new folder and preferably change at least the following:
* Server name
* Server port

If you want to host several public servers I guess you need to re-perform the Steam stuff described in "Hosting public servers" for each installation.

As mentioned above, if you care about disk space you can use symlinks to reuse most of the csgo installation files. But this is beyond the scope for this short intro.
