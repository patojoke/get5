The csgosl distribution includes sourcemod (and metamod), i.e. they are installed along with the csgo server. I'm new to using sourcemod and so far I only have been using it for being able to control stuff like voting, changing maps, harassing players.

To at least get started:

1. Run the game and connect to your server
2. Enable the developer console.
