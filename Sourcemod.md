The csgosl distribution includes sourcemod (and metamod), i.e. they are installed along with the csgo server. I'm new to using sourcemod and so far I only have been using it for being able to control stuff like voting, changing maps, harassing players.

To get started:

1. Run the game and connect to your server
2. Enable the developer console. (Enable Developer Console in Game settings, might have to bind a key to it, see [here](https://diaryofdennis.com/2015/09/19/how-to-activate-and-open-the-console-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/).)
3. Press the ~ key (the key over the TAB key, this is the default key). A window should open up.
4. Type sm_admin and press ENTER
5. Press ESC to close the console window. 

You now have a menu to the left where you can select different options using the number keys 0-9.

Sourcemod contains a lot of commands for controlling your server, e.g. look [here](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Admin_commands_(sourcemod)) for a list. You enter the commands in the same way you entered the sm_admin command above.
