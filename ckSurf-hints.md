csgosl takes care about most of the installation described [here](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=264498) but you need to perform some easy stuff yourself as well.

* Download the surf maps you want to host just as you would download any other map. [This](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=818042689) can be a good starting point for finding maps.
* Start the server on a surf map as a sourcemod admin.
* In the chat (NOT console) type:<br>
`!insertmapzones`

You should get a message about successful installation of zones.

And you're done! Use !help in the chat to get help about more ckSurf related stuff.

## Disclaimer
Since I don't use ckSurf myself I really don't know how it is supposed to work. I've tried out the basic steps described above, that's it. You try it out and tell me what I could add to make the csgosl support better.
