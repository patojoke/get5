# Help on Autoexec
This config page enables you to add config files to be run when your server is started or when map changes occur.<br> First add config files (ordinary text files named something.cfg) to either of the folders<br>
<install-folder>/server/csgo/cfg/csgosl/onserverstart or <br>
<install-folder>/server/csgo/cfg/csgosl/onmapchange<br>
<br>
Then start (or restart) csgosl, enter the Autoexec tab and enable the config files you want executed.<br>
Some config files are provided with csgosl and you can add your own as well.
