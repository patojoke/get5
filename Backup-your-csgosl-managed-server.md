# DISCLAIMER
Please note the below procedure assumes you have been using csgosl in the standard way, i.e. no manual
editing of config files or manually installed own source mod plugins, ... If you have done this the below procedure will describe how to restore your server but you will have to reapply all your manual changes yourself.

# Assumptions
Your source server is installed in <some-path>/csgosl. The source server is the one you want to backup.
Your backup will be stored in <backup-path>/csgosl. This folder will only contain what is necessary to backup, not the complete installation.
The target server will be installed in <some-other-path>/csgosl. The target server is the server you restore from the backup.
