## API authorization key
To host a workshop map you need an API autorization key which is issued by Valve on Steam. Just head over to the [Steam Registration page](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) and generate a key. Copy and paste this key into the **apiauthkey **setting on the Steam tab:

TODO: pictures...

Now you're ready to host your own maps (and map groups).

To select a new workshop map go here: [CSGO workshop maps](http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse?appid=730)

Select a map, e.g. [Waterloo](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=663589039&searchtext=)

Please note the number next to the "id=..." part. Copy and paste this number (663589039 in this example) into the **startmap **setting on the Run tab and start the server. That's it! The server will download the map from the workshop and your connecting friends will automatically download the map from the workshop when they connect to your server.
