This is the really easy case where you want to host a CSGO server on your local network (LAN) only. Only your friends on your LAN will be able to connect, people on the outside will not be able to connect via your Internet connection.

csgosl comes preconfigured for this case and all you need to do is press the "Start Server" button. Then just select "Browse community servers" in CSGO and select the LAN tab and your server should show up there.

For simplicity the server is setup without a password but you can set a password in the [Server tab](https://github.com/lenosisnickerboa/csgosl/wiki/Help-on-Server). There are also a number of settings in the [Run tab](https://github.com/lenosisnickerboa/csgosl/wiki/Help-on-Run).
