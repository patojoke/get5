Currently being implemented, stay tuned...

<TODO: insert pic here>

This page controls sourcemod functionality.

* **enable** Controls if sourcemod functionality is enabled.
* **onlylocal** Only enable sourcemod plugins on local servers (to avoid potential GSLT Valve ban, read more [here](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=279854) and [here](http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/server_guidelines/).)
* **admins** List all users (separated by space) you want to give admin permissions on your server. Users are identified by their steam id (e.g STEAM_1:1:12345678, see [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=209000244) for how to obtain this id) or the users ip address (e.g. 192.168.1.123).
